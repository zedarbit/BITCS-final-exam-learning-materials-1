Lab5 Survival guide!

From assignment:

"Right now, the program memory map is determined by how we load the
program into memory and set up the page table (so that they are
pointing to the right physical pages).  This is all implemented in
exec.c as part of the exec system call using the underlying support
provided to implement virtual memory in vm.c.  To change the memory
layout, you have to change the exec code to load the program and
allocate the stack in the new way that we want."

Specifically, lets start by opening up exec.c check the exec(...)
function which implements the system call.  Exec does the following:

Part 1. Opens the executable file and parses it.  The rest of this
paragraph is FYI.  Typically executable files are made up of a header
including information that allows us to index the rest of the file.
The file after that consists of sections including the code, the
global data, and sometimes other sections like uninitialized data.
These are the parts of the memory that we need to initialize from the
executable.  The header information includes the number of sections,
the start of each section in the file, and where it maps to in virtual
memory, and the length of each section.

Part 2. Initializes the kernel memory using setupkvm() which maps the
pages of the kernel to the process address space.  We dont really need
to know what happens in here.

Part 3. It then moves on to load the sections of the executable file
into memory using loaduvm() which creates the memory pages for each
section and maps them to the address space (by initializing the page
table pointers -- more details in a bit).  These sections in xv6 are
loaded starting at VA 0, and going up.  Each new section starts at the
beginning of a new page.  Recall that sections include code,
global/static data, etc..

**Conveniently, we can then keep track of where the user address space
ends, which also defines the size of the process using one value
(proc->sz).  So, as we map new pages, sz (rounded up to the next page)
can serve as their virtual address since we are simply filling in the
address space sequentially.  

In VM, we map virtual pages to physical frames.  XV6 has no swap so
all memory pages have to be in physical memory.  Physical memory is allocated by the kernel allocator kmalloc.  If you want to dig deeper (you need to for the bonus part) you will see how these pages are initialized using kinit() and kinit2() which are called during the boot process in main.c.  As a result, we use kmalloc() as we request each new page inside vm.c to allocate a new physical page.  

The vm.c functions such as allocuvm() typically follow this up with a
call to mappages which is used to initialize the page table entries
mapping the virtual address to the physical page that it just
allocated.  Otherwise these physical frames that we allocate cannot be
used by our process.

Part 4. At this point, we loaded code and data sections, and its time
to create the stack.  xv6 does not support a heap at the moment (there
is no malloc()/free() available to user programs if you noticed).  It
currently maps the stack in its virtual address space at a page right
after the last page we loaded from the executable (i.e., at sz rounded
up to the next page boundary).  

Since the stack grows down, allocating a page here means there is no
room to grow the stack -- as it grows down, it will run into the
code/data.  To protect against that, xv6 adds one page buffer and
marks it as unreadable so that in case the stack grows, we get a
memory error and can stop the program.  The code to create the stack is:

  sz = PGROUNDUP(sz);   //round sz up to the next page boundary since stack must start in a new page

  if((sz = allocuvm(pgdir, sz, sz + 2*PGSIZE)) == 0) // our first introduction to allocuvm; it allocates and maps two pages
    goto bad;
  clearpteu(pgdir, (char*)(sz - 2*PGSIZE)); //we clear the PTE for the first page to create a buffer page between stack and code/data

TODO 1: This is the part of the code that we need to change to move
the stack.  The current code calls allocuvm to create two pages, one for the stack
and one as a guard page starting at VA sz which is right after the
code and data.  It then clears the page table entry for the guard
page.

We want to locate the stack starting at the top of the
user address space to give it room to grow.  To understand what we
need to do, lets look at allocuvm.

It takes 3 parameters:

a.The page table (pgdir).  This will not change

b.The virtual address of the first page we are mapping -- this needs
to change to point to the top page of the user part of memory (right
under KERNBASE).  If you use kernbase, you will try to map the page to
the kernel address space.

c. The virtual address of the last page we are mapping.  For us, we
are creating a stack with only a single page, so this can another
address in the same page, slightly bigger than the first address.

Allocuvm allocates the page, and maps it to the page table.  So,
basically we are done with moving the stack by just changing these
parameters to the right value.  However, there are a few loose ends to
tie up.

Part 5: Finally, we initialize the stack pointer, currently to sz.

TODO 2: you will have to change this to the address of the top word in
the stack page.  Note that KERNBASE is the first word in the kernel
address space, so this is the word right under that.

We proceed to initialize the stack with the parameters for main as per
the linux/x86 stack convention.  The details are not important to us
for now.

Loose Ends/Other changes.
--------------------------

Now that we moved the stack, a few places in the Kernel that hard
coded the previous location of the stack have to be changed.  These
include:

TODO 3: All of the functions that are defined in syscall.c (and sysfile.c) for
accessing the user stack have some checks to see if the addresses are
indeed on the stack.  These checks compare the address against sz
since that was the top of the stack in the old implementation.  You
have to change those checks (or remove them if it is easier).  Check
all the accessor functions such as argint, argstr, argptr, argfd,
etc...

TODO 4: copyuvm().  This function is used as part of fork() to create
a copy of the address space of the parent process calling fork to the
child process.  It is implemented in vm.c

If you look at this function, it is one big for loop that iterates over the virtual address space and copies the pages one by one.  The loop starts with:

for(i = 0; i < sz; i += PGSIZE){

since it assumes the virtual address space starts at 0 and goes to sz.
Now this has to be changed to take into account the new stack.

If we look deeper, it reads the page table to get the PTE for the
page, allocates a new physical frames, and copies the page from the
parent memory to the new page.  Finally it uses mappages to map this
new copy to the child address space by adding a PTE to its page table.

How do we change it?  Now sz tracks the bottom part of the address
space, so its ok to leave that loop alone.  We have to keep track of
the size of the stack, and added another loop that iterates over the
stack page(s) and does the same thing (kmallocs a page for each one,
memmoves to create a copy from the parent, and then mapages() to add
it to page table).  

The loop will be very similar, with the exception of the virtual
address ranges that iterates over.  Before we add stack growth, the
stack is only one page, but as the stack grows we need to keep track
of the number of stack pages. To prepare for this, we need to add a
variable in struct proc to keep track of the size of the stack (in
pages or bytes--either is fine, but I recommend pages).  This counter
starts out with a stack of one page; set it in exec().

Debugging: If your stack moved correctly, xv6 will be able to boot
into shell successfully.  

If you dont allocate/map the stack correctly, you will get errors either in the
allocation functions (e.g., remapping errors) or as your program runs
(page faults).

If you dont take care of all the argint() etc.. functions some of your
system calls will not be able to pass parameters correctly.  The
results could be weird.  For example, printf won't print, and wait
wont wait (leading to init continuing to fork processes, etc...)


Growing the stack
-----------------

Now that our stack has been moved, we have room to grow it.  When the
a program causes the stack to grow to an offset bigger than one page,
at this point, we will be accessing a page that is not
allocated/mapped.  This will cause a page fault.  Basically, we will
trap to the trap handler in trap.c

In there there is a switch statement with a case for every supported
trap.  We need to add a case for page faults.  This page fault has
trap number 14 (or T_PGFLT) as defined in traps.h 

TODO 5: Add a case for the page fault.  When a page fault occurs, you can check
the address that caused the page fault in a hardware register called
CR2.  The CR register (standing for Control Register) keep track of
important hardware state information.  You can read the CR2 register
using the function rcr2().

Once you have the offending address, next we need to check if it is
from the page right under the current bottom of the stack.  If it is,
we need to grow the stack.  You can use allocuvm again, but you have
to initialize it with the right parameters to allocate one page at the
right place.  After that, you can increment your stack size counter,
which finishes your trap handler.

Voila! you should be good to go.


To check if the stack grows correctly, write a recursive program that
nests deep enough to get a stack longer than 1 page.  You should get a
page fault and grow the stack correctly if your implementation works.
